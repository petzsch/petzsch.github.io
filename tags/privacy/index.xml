However I had a blast in Prag talking to so many people.
I really love all the places where BTCPay is being used. And also all the commercial products that are being build ontop of it. Maybe one day a BTCPay fork would get ISO270001 certification (Security thing) If at one point I will be able to pay my train ticket with bitcoin.</description></item><item><title>Privacy - no more user tracking</title><link>https://petzsch.eu/post/2022-12-04-no-tracking/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>markus@petzsch.eu (Markus Petzsch)</author><guid>https://petzsch.eu/post/2022-12-04-no-tracking/</guid><description>Privacy for my users: No more Analytics on my Websites Just a short info: I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove the Matomo tracking code from my websites.
I value my own privacy when surfing online and so it occured to me, that I should respect the privacy of my users just the same.
I&amp;rsquo;m also thinking of replacing the DISQUS feature as it also includes way to many privacy traps (aka social networks).</description></item></channel></rss>

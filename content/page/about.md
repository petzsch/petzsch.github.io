My name is Markus Petzsch. I am a [DevOps Engineer at Sternico GmbH](https://sternico.com)
I work on all sorts of awesome projects and want to blog here about some cool technologies that I came across during my work.

My favorite topics of the time writing this are:

- Docker
- K8s
- CI/CD
- Jenkins
- GitLab CI
- many more

### my history

Just read my [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Markus_Petzsch) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/petzsch) page for that stuff.

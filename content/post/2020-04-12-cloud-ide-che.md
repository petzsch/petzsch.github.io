After comming across an article about Eclipse Che and Theia, I decided to give both a shot. It happens to be that the
[Azure Che Tutorial](https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/che-7/installing-eclipse-che-on-microsoft-azure/) is quite buggy and it took me a while
to get it running.

However this is a great addition to our online devops application stack (GitLab, Jenkins, Che) here at Sternico.

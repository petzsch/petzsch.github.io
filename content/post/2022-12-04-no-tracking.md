# Privacy for my users: No more Analytics on my Websites

**Just a short info:** I've decided to remove the Matomo tracking code from my websites.

I value my own privacy when surfing online and so it occured to me, that I should respect the privacy of my users just the same.

I'm also thinking of replacing the DISQUS feature as it also includes way to many privacy traps (aka social networks).

When setting up HUGO for this website I came acroos [ISSO](https://isso-comments.de/) - which still looks very promissing.

What do you think? Is this to radical or maybe a little late on my part? ðŸ¥¹

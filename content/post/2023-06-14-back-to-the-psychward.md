# I don't know if anybody is listening to what I have to say, as I don't ever get feedback.
However I had a blast in Prag talking to so many people.

I really love all the places where BTCPay is being used. And also all the commercial products that are being build ontop of it. Maybe one day a BTCPay fork would get ISO270001 certification (Security thing)
If at one point I will be able to pay my train ticket with bitcoin. I will know that we have made it.

End coporate Greed!
Run your own nodes and your own Miners!
Become decentralized.
Tear down the walled gardens when this war is over.

I will leave all my infrastructure open for the community. Hopefully this base, my little paradies never gets corrupted and my parents can live hear in peace.

I know I've broken a lot of promisses, but with btcpay I've found my new home. This DAO is awesome. Anyone willing to do an unpaid internship or maybe even a paid one, should apply.

Sorry my thoughts are so disorted. This is not AI generated and I've not even drawn a mindmap beforehand (maybe while typing in my head).

I've reported this strange pirate radio station in 99768 Ilfeld to the REGTP, let's see if they can find the source of it. I only have working thesis as allways.

If they take my domain, we will continue the conversation on [NOSTR](https://iris.to/petzsch) or on my nPUBs: npub1l2q2pyyjlt5qsgwnmk3ga0dme2aafj35j25fk878p58uzanyfcsqqzlgc2
